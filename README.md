# Virtual Fashion Try-On

## Project Overview
A simple `Django web application` for **upper-body** virtual fashion try-on. Users upload their ***photo*** (upper body/portrait) and describe clothing in ***text*** to see themselves wearing the generated outfit.

## Target Audience
- General public interested in trying virtual fashion

## Core Features
1. **Photo Upload**: Upper body/portrait photos only
2. **Text Description**: Simple clothing descriptions (e.g., "red hoodie", "blue formal shirt")
3. **AI Processing**: our platform will generate the mask for the uploaded image, then generate the correct cloth from the text description, then try the generated cloth on the photo uploaded
4. **Results Display**: Displaying to the user the original photo, the text description, and the final virtual try on result
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar during processing
